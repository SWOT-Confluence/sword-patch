SWORD (https://www.swordexplorer.com) is an amazing resource, and is continually updated, but cannot be made perfect for all applications. 

So, the DAWG has come up with a strategy to create "patches" for SWORD, to be read in by Confluence, and to improve FLPE.

This repo is designed to store both:
1) a json file of changes or "patches" to apply to the SWORD data, and 
2) miscellaneous tools to diagnose SWORD issues and create patches.

The native list of changes is stored in the sword_patches_vxxx.json file, where xxx is the three-digit SWORD version number. (The three-digit version number can be found in the L2 Single Pass xml file, with the tag "xref_prior_river_db_files".

There will be a separate file for each SWORD version, and one version for eqch continent.
